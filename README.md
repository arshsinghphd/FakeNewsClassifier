PROJECT TITLE:<br>
Fake News Classifier

SKILLS:<br>
In this project I demonstrate the knowledge and understanding of *Deep Learning* using *Artificial Neural Network* models using *keras* for *Natural Language Processing*. 

<details>
<summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
I am Arsh Singh, my PhD is in Applied Microeconomics, and I am interested in applied data science.

GOAL:<br>
I am testing an artificial neural network classification model using keras for identifying fake news from the text data (NLP).

DATA:<br>
WELFake Data Set consists of 72,134 news articles with 35,028 real and 37,106 fake news. For this, authors merged four popular news datasets (i.e. Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political) to prevent over-fitting of classifiers and to provide more text data for better ML training. <br>

  Dataset contains four columns:<br> 
  Serial number (starting from 0);<br> 
  Title (about the text news heading);<br> 
  Text (about the news content); and <br>
  Label (0 = fake and 1 = real).<br>


DATA SOURCE:<br>
Dataset originally compiled by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9395133">P. K. Verma, P. Agrawal, I. Amorim and R. Prodan, "WELFake: Word Embedding Over Linguistic Features for Fake News Detection," in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 881-893, Aug. 2021, doi: 10.1109/TCSS.2021.3068519.</a>
 

MAIN RESULT:<br>
I am able to classify fake news with 97% accuracy using my model.
